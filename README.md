# gcn-collisions
This Graph Convolutional Network learns to simulate collision responses for particles. Speedups can be seen for large numbers of particles. The network can also learn to account for symmetry-breaking from a reference algorithm.

## Notice

If you do decide to use the codebase, I would appreciate a mention of my name in any releases. Feel free to also send me a message, I'd love to see what you are developing.

I haven't used anyone else's code, but this idea stemmed from Deepmind's "Learning to Simulate Complex Physics with Graph Networks (ICML 2020)". I feel like some credit therefore is due. Do take a look at their links, the project is very impressive and much larger in scope than this one.
